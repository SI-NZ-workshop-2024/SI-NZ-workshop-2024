## Keynotes

[Assoc. Prof. Judy Bowen](https://profiles.waikato.ac.nz/judy.bowen), University of Waikato, New Zealand

**Title:** From There to Here (and back again)

**Abstract:** Software Engineering is a diverse field with researchers and practitioners often working in different sub-disciplines, however, they typically share common perceptions of the foundations of the discipline which they apply within their own contexts. My own research focusses on the design and development of  interactive and ubiquitous systems guided by relevant software engineering principles from HCI, formal methods and testing.
In this talk I will describe what software engineering means in the context of my work, where I started from, where I’ve ended up and why the things I focus on matter in the wider context of software evolution.

**Bio:** Judy Bowen is an Associate Professor in Software Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Waikato. Originally from South Wales, Judy moved to New Zealand in 1999 and completed her MSc and PhD at the University of Waikato, both in the area of the use of formal methods for interactive system design. Her research spans the disciplines of software engineering and human-computer interaction and focusses on interactive system design, model-driven development and testing. Recently her research has focussed more on  the impacts of ubiquitous technology, wearable technology and  IoT solutions on end-users.

# SI^NZ workshop 2024 Student Symposium

### Call for Submissions

The Student Symposium aims to provide a helpful and stimulating forum for current postgraduate students (PhD and Masters) to present and discuss their research proposals and early research results. Experienced members of the SI^NZ community will serve as advisers to provide constructive feedback on the research proposals. Participants must be current postgraduate research students, preferably those who have identified their research topic and progressed on initial results. However, other students are also welcome to attend.

Students must submit a two-page, single-authored abstract (see the submission format below). The submission should include the following elements: the research problem and motivation, background and related work, approach and novelty, results (if any), and contributions. The review process is not anonymous - there is no need to anonymise the submission.

A panel of experts will review the submissions and select the students to participate in the Students' Symposium. Students of accepted submissions will present their research to the panel (and other students) during the symposium. The abstract will not be published.

**Important dates**

**Submission:** May 20th, 2024

**Notifications:** May 31st, 2024<br>

**Submission**
<br>
Please submit your papers via EasyChair using the following link: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sinzstudentsymposium0](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sinzstudentsymposium0)
<br>
<br>
All submissions should use the official ACM Primary Article Template [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

Students can register for free through the eventbrite page, select the "Student Symposium" option and check out. 

## Schedule

Students will be able to attend the main session with the symposium taking place during Sessions 2 and 3 of the program. The student symposium schedule is as below:

# Code of Conduct

Software Innovation New Zealand is committed to providing a welcoming space for all attendees. A primary goal of our workshops and seminars is to promote the open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression among software engineering researchers in Aotearoa. These require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group; fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect; and embraces diversity.

For these reasons, Software Innovation New Zealand is dedicated to providing an inclusive harassment-free experience for participants at our events and in official communications channels, including social media. We want every participant to feel welcome, included, respected, and safe. There is no tolerance for unwelcome or hostile behaviour or speech that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes with a person’s participation or opportunity for participation at our workshop and events.

Please see the following for the workshop's full code of conduct policy: [Code of Conduct.pdf](https://si-nz-workshop-2024.github.io/SI-NZ-workshop-2024/SINZ_Code_of_Conduct.pdf) ⬇️
